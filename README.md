# Lithium-Cell-Capacity-Tester-ADI
In this project we have built a Li-ion cell capacity tester which can calculate the capacity of a lithium battery by charging it and then discharging it at a constant current.

From a simple hand-held trimmer to a super-fast electric car Lithium battery have found their way into a lot of applications in recent times. The voltage of a single lithium cell normally varies between 3.2V to 4.2V, it is often common to combine them to form a battery pack that can provide higher voltage and capacity. You can check out this article on Lithium-Ion Batteries if you are interested to know more about lithium cells and how they are used in a battery packs. In this article we will learning how to build a Lithium Cell Capacity Tester, special thanks to Digi-key for not only being a sponsor, but also for the timely shipping of all the required components used in this project. !
